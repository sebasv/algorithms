# An assortment of algorithms 

This repo contains plain and simple implementations of algorithms. 
The primary purpose of this repo is to be able to copy-paste the core of an algorithm into an application where I need it. 
Forget DRY, forget APIs, forget handling incorrect user input.
The code you find here needs to be tailored to your application.
A document with pseudo-code would have been more appropriate instead of this repo, but where is the fun in that.
Chances are, you are better off porting the algorithm to the language you are developing in.
Use only if you understand the inner workings of the algorithm!
